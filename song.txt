Legends never die when the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
